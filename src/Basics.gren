-- MATHEMATICS


{-| An `Int` is a whole number. Valid syntax for integers includes:

    0

    42

    9000

    0xFF -- 255 in hexadecimal

    0x0A --  10 in hexadecimal

**Note:** `Int` math is well-defined in the range `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`. Outside
of that range, the behavior is determined by the compilation target. When
generating JavaScript, the safe range expands to `-(2^53 - 1)` to `2^53 - 1` for some
operations, but if we generate WebAssembly some day, we would do the traditional
[integer overflow][io]. This quirk is necessary to get good performance on
quirky compilation targets.

**Historical Note:** The name `Int` comes from the term [integer]. It appears
that the `int` abbreviation was introduced in [ALGOL 68][68], shortening it
from `integer` in [ALGOL 60][60]. Today, almost all programming languages use
this abbreviation.

-}
type Int
    = Int -- NOTE: The compiler provides the real implementation.


{-| A `Float` is a [floating-point number][fp]. Valid syntax for floats includes:

    0
    42
    3.14
    0.1234
    6.022e23   -- == (6.022 * 10^23)
    6.022e+23  -- == (6.022 * 10^23)
    1.602e−19  -- == (1.602 * 10^-19)
    1e3        -- == (1 * 10^3) == 1000

**Historical Note:** The particular details of floats (e.g. `NaN`) are
specified by [IEEE 754][ieee] which is literally hard-coded into almost all
CPUs in the world. That means if you think `NaN` is weird, you must
successfully overtake Intel and AMD with a chip that is not backwards
compatible with any widely-used assembly language.

-}
type Float
    = Float -- NOTE: The compiler provides the real implementation.


{-| A `Unit` is a type which has exactly one value. It might seem strange that
someone would ever use such a type, but it comes in handy as a placeholder when
you need a value, but don't really care what it is.

    delayed =
        Process.sleep 500
            |> Task.andThen (\Unit -> Time.now)

In the code above, we wait for 500 milliseconds before getting the current time.
Since there's no reasonable value to pass on to the callback after waiting, and
since passing on a value is required by the Task API, we pass the `Unit` value.

-}
type Unit
    = Unit


{-| Add two numbers. The `number` type variable means this operation can be
specialized to `Int -> Int -> Int` or to `Float -> Float -> Float`. So you
can do things like this:

    3002 + 4004 == 7006 -- all ints

    3.14 + 3.14 == 6.28 -- all floats

You _cannot_ add an `Int` and a `Float` directly though. Use functions like
[toFloat](#toFloat) or [round](#round) to convert both values to the same type.
So if you needed to add a list length to a `Float` for some reason, you
could say one of these:

    3.14 + toFloat (List.length [ 1, 2, 3 ]) == 6.14

    round 3.14 + List.length [ 1, 2, 3 ] == 6

**Note:** Languages like Java and JavaScript automatically convert `Int` values
to `Float` values when you mix and match. This can make it difficult to be sure
exactly what type of number you are dealing with. When you try to _infer_ these
conversions (as Scala does) it can be even more confusing. Gren has opted for a
design that makes all conversions explicit.

-- EQUALITY


{-| Check if values are &ldquo;the same&rdquo;.

**Note:** Gren uses structural equality on tuples, records, and user-defined
union types. This means the values `(3, 4)` and `(3, 4)` are definitely equal.
This is not true in languages like JavaScript that use reference equality on
objects.

**Note:** Do not use `(==)` with functions, JSON values from `gren/json`, or
regular expressions from `gren/regex`. It does not work. It will crash if
possible. With JSON values, decode to Gren values before doing any equality
checks!

Why is it like this? Equality in the Gren sense can be difficult or impossible
to compute. Proving that functions are the same is [undecidable], and JSON
values can come in through ports and have functions, cycles, and new JS data
types that interact weirdly with our equality implementation. In a future
release, the compiler will detect when `(==)` is used with problematic types
and provide a helpful error message at compile time. This will require some
pretty serious infrastructure work, so the stopgap is to crash as quickly as
possible.

    (g << f) == (\x -> g (f x))

So our example expands out to something like this:

    \n -> not (isEven (sqrt n))

-}
composeL : (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
composeL g f x =
    g (f x)


{-| Function composition, passing results along in the suggested direction. For
example, the following code checks if the square root of a number is odd:

    sqrt >> isEven >> not

-}
composeR : (a -> b) -> (b -> c) -> (a -> c)
composeR f g x =
    g (f x)


{-| Saying `x |> f` is exactly the same as `f x`.

It is called the “pipe” operator because it lets you write “pipelined” code.
For example, say we have a `sanitize` function for turning user input into
integers:

    -- BEFORE
    sanitize : String -> Maybe Int
    sanitize input =
        String.toInt (String.trim input)

We can rewrite it like this:

    -- AFTER
    sanitize : String -> Maybe Int
    sanitize input =
        input
            |> String.trim
            |> String.toInt

Totally equivalent! I recommend trying to rewrite code that uses `x |> f`
into code like `f x` until there are no pipes left. That can help you build
your intuition.

**Note:** This can be overused! I think folks find it quite neat, but when you
have three or four steps, the code often gets clearer if you break out a
top-level helper function. Now the transformation has a name. The arguments are
named. It has a type annotation. It is much more self-documenting that way!
Testing the logic gets easier too. Nice side benefit!

-}
apR : a -> (a -> b) -> b
apR x f =
    f x


{-| Saying `f <| x` is exactly the same as `f x`.

It can help you avoid parentheses, which can be nice sometimes. Maybe you want
to apply a function to a `case` expression? That sort of thing.

-}
apL : (a -> b) -> a -> b
apL f x =
    f x


{-| Given a value, returns exactly the same value. This is called
[the identity function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_function).
-}
identity : a -> a
identity x =
    x


{-| Create a function that _always_ returns the same value. Useful with
functions like `map`:

    List.map (always 0) [1,2,3,4,5] == [0,0,0,0,0]

    -- List.map (\_ -> 0) [1,2,3,4,5] == [0,0,0,0,0]
    -- always = (\x _ -> x)

-}
always : a -> b -> a
always a _ =
    a


{-| A value that can never happen! For context:

  - The boolean type `Bool` has two values: `True` and `False`
  - The unit type `()` has one value: `()`
  - The never type `Never` has no values!

You may see it in the wild in `Html Never` which means this HTML will never
produce any messages. You would need to write an event handler like
`onClick ??? : Attribute Never` but how can we fill in the question marks?!
So there cannot be any event handlers on that HTML.

You may also see this used with tasks that never fail, like `Task Never ()`.

The `Never` type is useful for restricting _arguments_ to a function. Maybe my
API can only accept HTML without event handlers, so I require `Html Never` and
users can give `Html msg` and everything will go fine. Generally speaking, you
do not want `Never` in your return types though.

-}
type Never
    = JustOneMore Never


{-| A function that can never be called. Seems extremely pointless, but it
_can_ come in handy. Imagine you have some HTML that should never produce any
messages. And say you want to use it in some other HTML that _does_ produce
messages. You could say:

    import Html exposing (..)

    embedHtml : Html Never -> Html msg
    embedHtml staticStuff =
        div []
            [ text "hello"
            , Html.map never staticStuff
            ]

So the `never` function is basically telling the type system, make sure no one
ever calls me!

-}
never : Never -> a
never (JustOneMore nvr) =
    never nvr
